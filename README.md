# Pokedex

The Pokédex (ポケモン図鑑 Pokemon Zukan) is an electronic device designed to catalogue and provide information regarding the various species of Pokémon featured in the Pokémon video game, anime and manga series. The name Pokédex is a neologism including "Pokémon" (which itself is a portmanteau of "pocket" and "monster") and "index". The Japanese name is simply "Pokémon Encyclopedia", and it can feature every Pokémon on it, depending on the Pokédex.

## Android

The Android app are made with Kotlin language. I have spent 5 hours to make the Android version. As expected, I have not encountered any performance issues in low specs smartphones.

## iOS

## Ionic

## React Native

I have spent 12 hours to make the React Native, most of the time i spent trying to fix a problem with the read of .csv files and trying to made the Master Detail layout with an elegant code. To run in Android with better performance, try to run ```react-native run-android --variant=release```.
